This is a sample app that goes through the OAuth authorization dance
and then makes a single Latitude request.

First, go to https://www.google.com/accounts/ManageDomains to register and
verify an app domain.  This should provide you with an OAuth consumer key and
an OAuth consumer secret.  The app needs to be configured with these values.

To start the app, run:

    tools/gae run app

To configure the app with your consumer key and secret, leave the app running,
open a new terminal window, and type this command:

    tools/console

This will give you a Python prompt.  At the prompt, type these commands:

    >>> from main import Config
    >>> Config.set('oauth_consumer_key', '<your consumer key>')
    >>> Config.set('oauth_consumer_secret', '<your consumer secret>')

Then, to authorize and perform the request, go to:

    http://localhost:8080/

The main application behaviour is in main.py, so you would probably start
there to develop your app.  (You shouldn't need to edit the modules
latitude.py, oauth.py, oauth_appengine.py, and oauth_webapp.py, which
implement the OAuth client.)

Notes:
troubleshooting: if you can login but oauth does nothing, ie blank screen,
try deleting member data, to force oauth to re-authorize
