= Using Bulk Loader =

Google's App Engine offers a powerful set of tools for bulk loading data. We use it in Moveable Weather for uploading a [http://www.boutell.com/zipcodes/ freely-available CSV file] containing locational information about all U.S. zip codes.

This is a great alternative to web based services for doing on-the-fly zip code resolution, because it eliminates any worries we might have about bumping up against usage limits.


= Details =

There is great power in the bulk upload facility, and along with this power, comes complexity. Moveable Weather includes the following components, which you can use, to upload the data:

  * bulkloader.yaml: a configuration file needed by the bulk loader
  * zipcode.csv: comprises a database U.S zip codes, with their cities, states, latitudes and longitudes
  * app/Makefile: contains some useful "make" targets for doing the uploading and configuration
