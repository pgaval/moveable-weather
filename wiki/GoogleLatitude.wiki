#summary Moveable Weather gets it's locational data, for users, from Google Latitude, by using the Google Latitude API.

= Introduction =

Typically, if the user is carrying a smart phone, like an iPhone, an Android device, or a Blackberry, Google Latitude is updating the user's location continually.  Alternatively, a user can update their location by moving their avatar around a Google Map from their iGoogle home page, and still reliably update the Latitude location.

The only call to Google Latitude we really need to make is
{{{
        result = latitude.Latitude(client).get_current_location()
}}}

However, this one line is deceptively simple, because the _client_ object encapsulates the fact that a user has authenticated Moveable Weather to acccess the Latitude data. For that authentication, we need OAuth.

Thanks to some helpful engineers at Google, we really don't have to concern ourselves much with the intricacies of of the "oauth dance". This is because they have provided a very [https://groups.google.com/group/google-latitude-api/browse_thread/thread/2556e289d98def0c/31ca0d93309eae14?lnk=gst&q=ping#31ca0d93309eae14 helpful demo], that contains all the code we need. In Moveable Weather, this code is embodied in the following files:
