= Introduction =

If the user is carrying a smart phone, like an iPhone, an Android device, or a Blackberry, Google Latitude can continually update his location.  Alternatively, the user can simulate this movement by moving his avatar around a Google Map from the  iGoogle home page.

The crucial call to Google Latitude is
{{{
result = latitude.Latitude(client).get_current_location()
}}}

However, this one line is deceptively simple, because the _client_ object encapsulates the fact that a user has authenticated Moveable Weather to acccess the Latitude data. For that authentication, we need OAuth.
