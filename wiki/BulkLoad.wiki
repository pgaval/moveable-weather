#summary Use the Bulk Loader facility of App Engine to upload your zipcode.csv file

= Introduction =

The zipcode.csv file, [http://www.boutell.com/zipcodes/ freely available], has been altered slightly, for use with Moveable Weather. An extra field, called `has_location` has been added to the end of each line. Initially, the value of this field is set to `0` for each line. After you upload the `zipcode.csv` file, you will need to loop through each record in this data, calling a special method called `update_location`. The purpose of this method, inherited from the `GeoName` class, is to ensure that each latitude,longitude pair is stored in a _geohash_. This will enable _proximity searches_, which are critical.

The reason proximity searches are necessary is that each zip code in the database is associated with a partilar latitude/longitude pair which we can thing of as occupying the center of the particular zip code. But data about a user's location, coming in via Google Latitude, will be arbitrary, and thus, we'll need to be able to compute which zip code's "neighborhood" it falls withing. This is what a proximity search is.
