#summary A simple "unofficial" weather UI.

We use the [http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/02/08/googles-secret-weather-api/ Google Weather API] in Moveable Weather, because it is simple, non-metered, and free. The API can accept urls using place names or Zip Codes:

{{{
 trop.say ("%s,%s. Weather condition: %s. Temperature: %s.  Wind: %s." % (city, state1, condition, temp_f, wind))
}}}
