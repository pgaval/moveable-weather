Perform the following steps.

   #  Go to https://www.google.com/accounts/ManageDomains
   #  Choose the "upload an html file" method
      * Google will offer you file with a name like `googlead47db9711b4789c.html` for download
      * One way to verify this url is to set it up as an endpoint of your App Engine app. You can do this by
globally substituting in the name of your special download file for `googlead47db9711b4789c.html` in main.py
      * Update your App Engine app, using the App Engine launcher, or by issuing the command:
           {{{
               appcfg.py update .
          }}}
  from your app directory.

       * Now visit http://MY_APP.appspot.com/googlead47db9711b4789c.html
       * Press the Verify button.   
       * Google gives you back the consumser secret, something like:
             `wiExtkNLdsYsKwiExtkNLdsYsK`
         
       * Copy this down somewhere
       * When Google  ask you for the target url path prefix, use
                /_oauth_callback
