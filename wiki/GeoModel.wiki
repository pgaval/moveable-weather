GeoModel
we load all the locations, using bulkloader
then we iterate through the locations, calling update_location
      """Syncs underlying geocell properties with the entity's location.

    Updates the underlying geocell properties of the entity to match the
    entity's location property. A put() must occur after this call to save
    the changes to App Engine."""


geomodel.py
"""Defines the GeoModel class for running basic geospatial queries on
single-point geographic entities in Google App Engine.

TODO(romannurik): document how bounding box and proximity queries work.
"""

Here's the crucial call

      zip_records = model.ZipCode.proximity_fetch(
                            model.ZipCode.all(),  # Rich query!
                            geo.geotypes.Point(lat, lng),  # Or db.GeoPt
                            max_results=10,
                            max_distance=16000)  # Within 100 miles.
