# Download and Customize the Source Files
Pull the source code from http://code.google.com/p/moveable-weather/
Go to Google App Engine, and create a new app called MY_APP
Edit ./app/my-globals.py
     MY_OAUTHCONSUMER_SECRET = "YOUR OAUTH_CONSUMER_SECRET"
     APP_NAME = "your app name id"
     PRETTY_APP_NAME="your app name"
     PRETTY_APP_PHONE="Tropo number that starts your app"

Edit ./app/Makefile
     Change value of APP in Makefile to what you used for MY_APP, above

# Create a new Tropo App

Go to tropo.com, and create a new app, called TROPO_APP


Setting Up the Tropo Interface
   Sign up for Tropo
   Create an application, called MY_TROPO_APP
   Set http://MY_APP.appspot.com/tropo_multi_weather.py as the start point



# As a prerequisite for using OAuth, Register the domain of your app

     Go to https://www.google.com/accounts/ManageDomains
       Use the "upload an html file" method
          First, Google gives a file called something like 
             googlead47db9711b4789c.html,  to download
          Google tells you to press the "Verify" button when ready, but first

            Edit main.py changing the following 
              line to what the ManageDomains page give you:

             ('/googlead47db9711b4789c.html', GoogleVerifyDomain),

             Change the GoogleVerifyDomain class in main.py substituting in 
               the contents of googlead47db9711b4789c.html

            Upload your app to App Engine for the first time:
            Visit the url http://MY_APP.appspot.com/googlead47db9711b4789c.html
          Now you can pretty the Verify button

          Google gives you back the consumser secret, something like:
             wiExtkNLdsYsKwiExtkNLdsYsK
          Copy this down somewhere
          When Google  ask you for the target url path prefix, use
                /_oauth_callback
       
# Finish customizing the Python Source Files

          Now you're ready to fill out the contents of the variable in 
	       app/my_globals.py

   in app/my_globals.py set the value of PRETTY_APP_PHONE, which is the 
       phone number Tropo assigns to your app

Edit ./app/my-globals.py
     MY_OAUTHCONSUMER_SECRET = "YOUR OAUTH_CONSUMER_SECRET"
     APP_NAME = "your app name id"
     PRETTY_APP_NAME="your app name"
     PRETTY_APP_PHONE="Tropo number that starts your app"


# Bulk upload zip code data

Bulk upload all the Zip Code data to your App Engine app
   First, edit ./app/Makefile, setting APP to MY_APP
   Run "make upload" to bulkload the zipcode csvsfile
       This may take a while, like an hour
   Process all you uploaded Zip Code data so that it goes into the GeoHash
   Do this by running the following loop, in a UNIX shell, in the ./app directory
         $ while(1)
             ? make  fill LIMIT=100

   Let this run until it starts coming back, saying that it's processing 0 zip codes
