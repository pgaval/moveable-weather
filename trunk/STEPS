Create a new app called moveable-weather, 
Edit my-globals.py
Change value of APP in Makefile to moveable-weather
Register your domain for oauth
  by going to https://www.google.com/accounts/ManageDomains
 
  Use the "upload an html file" method
    create a special handler in appengine to field the url
  
  when they ask you for the target url path prefix, use
           /oath_callback
   This gives you  MY_OAUTHCONSUMER_SECRET = "wiExtkNLdsYsKAGZhhnyEemY"

   (I just ran /set_my_oauth, because I was getting errors still)

run "make upload" to bulkload the zipcode csvsfile
