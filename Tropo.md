# Introduction #

The Tropo Web API is a JSON interface to Voxeo's voice features. In recent months, libraries in various languages have been added, as a layer that sits above the JSON. Among these is the [Tropo Web API for Python](http://github.com/tropo/tropo-webapi-python/blob/master//README), and this is what we use in the implementation of Moveable Weather.
